# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Overview

This project is a text-based adventure game where players embark on a mystical journey in the Whispering Woods. As the guide, you must help the traveler, Elara, navigate through challenges, choices, and consequences to find the lost Gem of Serenity. The game dynamically adapts the tale based on the player's decisions, creating a branching narrative experience.

## Features

- Interactive storytelling experience
- Branching narrative paths based on player choices
- Dynamic adaptation of the story
- Death paths with explanatory responses
- Use of natural language processing for AI interactions

## Technologies Used

- Cassandra: For storing chat message history and conversation data.
- OpenAI: For natural language processing to generate AI responses.
- Python: For coding the game logic and interaction.
- GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python if you haven't already.
3. Set up Cassandra and create a keyspace for storing chat history.
4. Obtain an OpenAI API key.
5. Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
6. Update the configuration files with your Cassandra credentials and OpenAI API key.
7. Run the game script and start playing!

## Usage

To play the game, simply run the main script and follow the prompts to interact with the AI:

```bash
python main.py
```
